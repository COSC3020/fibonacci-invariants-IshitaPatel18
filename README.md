# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.

My answer: The invariant for this recursive implementation is, the elements at the indices of the arr[0...i-1] are the sum of the 2 elements before them, where the value of the first two elements is the value of themselves. My reasoning for this invariant is because every element but the first two elements, share the same pattern, that is the sum of the two elements before them in the array, since this implementation results in an array of the fibonacci numbers. So, I mention that the array from the beginning to the previous iteration has that pattern, specifying that the first two elements are the value of themselves. The basis of my invariant came from $a_k = a_{k-1} + a_{k -2}$ where $a_0 = 0$ and $a_1 = 1$ which uses recursion to solve.
